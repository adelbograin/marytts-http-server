[[introduction]]
= Introduction

This is the REST documentation for the HTTP Server RESTFUL wrapper of the multilingual open-source Mary 
 text-to-speech platform (MaryTTS). MaryTTS can be found on https://github.com/marytts/marytts/[this page].

NOTE: This documentation applies to MaryTTS HTTP Server running on local machine (localhost) on port 59125.
If you are not sure how to run the server, please refer to https://github.com/marytts/marytts-http-server/tree/master[this documentation].

[[overview]]
= Overview
A brief overview of HTTP verbs & status codes.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs
Person-service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.
|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, full updates only

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes
Person-service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used.
In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
